# MetalLB
The documentation for this on-premise load balancing service is at [MetalLB.org](https://metallb.org/). MetalLB was originally created by Dave Anderson, a Google SRE.  
I chose this load balancer for my home K8s cluster because it supports TCP and UDP on a single IP, which DNS (I run PiHole) needs.

There is an interview on the [Kubernetes podcast from December 2018](https://overcast.fm/+MqPkBJf4o) where Dave is interviewed on the show. Give it a listen.
